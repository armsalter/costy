🎉 Introducing Costy – A Stylish Clothing Store Web Experience! 👗🛍️

I'm excited to share Costy, a fully responsive and visually engaging clothing store website I designed and developed! 💻✨

This project was built using modern front-end technologies including:

🔹 HTML5 – for clean and semantic structure
🔹 Sass (SCSS) – to craft a stylish and maintainable design
🔹 JavaScript – for dynamic interactions and user-friendly features

To simulate real-world functionality, I implemented a fake database with dummy data, allowing the site to behave like a functional e-commerce platform – with product listings, filters, and detailed item views.

💡 Key Highlights:

Fully responsive design – looks great on all screen sizes 📱💻

Smooth user experience with interactive elements 🔄

Clean and modern UI, tailored for fashion retail 🎨🧥

This project helped me enhance my front-end development skills and gain experience in designing e-commerce interfaces from scratch.

🚀 Feel free to explore the project on my GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn for more exciting builds!
